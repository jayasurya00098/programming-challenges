## beginner problems

###### Question 1:
    - Problem Description: Write a program to print all Natural numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user.
    - Problem Constraints: 1 <= N <= 1000000
    - Input Format: A single line representing N
    - Output Format: N space separated integers from 1 to N.

    **Example**
    Input: ``5``
    Output: ``1 2 3 4 5``

###### Question 2:
    - Problem Description: Given an integer N, print N stars in a single line. For example if N = 5 then pattern will be like: 
    ```*****```
    - Problem Constraints: 2 <= N <= 100
    - Input Format: Single line input contains a single integer N.
    - Output Format: Output N stars in a single line.

    **Example**
