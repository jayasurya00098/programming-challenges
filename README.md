This repository consists of python programming challenges with its solutions.

## beginner problems

###### Question 1:
    - Problem Description: Write a program to print all Natural numbers from 1 to N where you have to take N as input from user.
    - Problem Constraints: 1 <= N <= 1000000
    - Input Format: A single line representing N
    - Output Format: N space separated integers from 1 to N.

    **Example**
    Input:
    5
    Output: 
    1 2 3 4 5

###### Question 2:
    - Problem Description: Given an integer N, print N stars in a single line. For example if N = 5 then pattern will be like: 
    ```*****```
    - Problem Constraints: 2 <= N <= 100
    - Input Format: Single line input contains a single integer N.
    - Output Format: Output N stars in a single line.

    **Example**
    Input:
    3
    Output:
    ***

###### Question 3:
    - Take an integer N as input, print the corresponding stair pattern for N.
    For example if N = 4 then stair pattern will be like:
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    - Problem Constraints: 1 <= N <= 100
    - Input Format: Single line input contains a single integer N.
    - Output Format: Output the stair pattern corresponding to the given N.

    **Example**
    Input:
    3
    Output:
    *
    **
    ***

###### Question 4:
    - Take T (number of test cases) as input. For each test case, take integer N as input and Print the count of digits of that number.
    No of digits for number 0 is considered as 1.
    - Problem Constraints: 
    - 1 <= T <= 100
    - 0 <= N <= 100000000
    - Input Format:
    - The first line is the number T which denotes the total number of test cases.
    - Next T lines contain an integer N for which you have to print the number of digits.
    - Output Format: 
    - For T different Numbers, Print the number of digits in separate lines.

    **Example**
    Input:
    - 2
    - 100
    - 10101
    Output:
    - 3
    - 5
